# static-box

***This crate is in an early development stage. There are no tests, documentation, examples for this crate.***

To deal with trait objects, this crate uses a lot of nightly features.

This code has been inspired by the [`thin_box`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5ade3fe32c8a742504aaddcbe0d6e498f8eae11d/library/core/tests/ptr.rs#L561) example in the rustic tests repository.
